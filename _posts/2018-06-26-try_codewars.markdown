Recently, I took an interest in Codewars. I have a friend who was pretty much addicted to it and went on and on about Codewars for days at end. So being a curious individual, I wanted to see what this Codewars was all about. Basically, Codewars is a collection of online code challenges called Kata to solve. You start off as a beginner (8kyu) and make your way up (difficulty level goes all the way up to 1kyu) as you progress.

I have to say Codewars is cool stuff! It’s basically having fun while solving a puzzle but it’s also a lot of swearing and cursing while you are at it but FUN is the key word here! It’s not really serious code; you don’t lose anything if you get it wrong or if you take all the time in the world to solve it but you are learning so much in the process and did I mention about the fun part? One of the amazing features about Codewars is that once you solve your kata (Or don’t. You lose point if you unlock the solutions without solving the kata), you are allowed to look at other people's solution to the same challenge. It is amazing to see how many different ways there are to solve a problem. Sometimes, you see a 1 liner code and your jaw drops, and sometimes, you give yourself a pat on the back and bask in your cleverness.

Alot of the code challenges in Codewars are about algorithms so the more you do, the better you get at learning how to use the right tools to solve the problem and also to think strategically and logically. So, Codewars is definitely something I would recommend for beginner programmers. It is tough at first but if you keep at it, you become better and yes once you start you can’t stop.
